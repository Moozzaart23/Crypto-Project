# BLOCKCHAIN IN STORING MEDICAL HEALTH RECORDS

 -The folder Server hosts a hotspot network and both the clients namely Client_Amogh and Client_Akhil can request to add a 
transaction and the transaction gets reflected in all the other laptops. You can add clients and make sufficient changes to the program.

 -Java is used to implement this entire Block Chain for medical health records. Java TCP Socket Programming is used to establish connection.
 
 -The object is serialized and sent to all other connected laptops. 
 
 -Net beans IDE have been used for the implementation of this project.
 
 -SQLite manager has been used to implement the database function and SQL tables in all the laptops. The Block database table represents
our Block Chain.

 -Whenever a laptop wants to add a block he has to press 1 after running the code and input according to the message 
displayed on the screen and has to enter 0 if he does not want to enter a block. 

 -Whenever a laptop wants to add a block, it checks whether the patient already exists in the block chain 
through Zero Knowledge proof and updates the block chain accordingly. 

 -Whenever there is a change in the length of the block chain, the new transaction gets mined on all
the other laptops  and hence the peer to peer connection of block chain is established.

 -After the successful compilation of the program the updated block chain will be printed.
